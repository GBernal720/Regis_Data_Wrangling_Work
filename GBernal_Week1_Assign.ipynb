    "\n",
    "The comment above the CSV section makes an assumption and says it wouldn't work for large files. Use the following articles to understand the terms **eager evaluation** and **lazy evaluation**:\n",
    "* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eager_evaluation\n",
    "* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now answer the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In light of the two definitions above, what is the assumption made by that comment?\n",
    "\n",
    "An eager evaluation in computer programming is known as a strict evaluation. This type of expression is evaluated as soon as it is bounded to a variable. A lazy evaluation is also known as call-by-need. This expression is evaluated when it is needed. After reviewing the two definitions and examples of them the expressions used are eager evaluations. This is because there are no conditional statements that would need to be checked for this code to run. Instead it is running as soon as it is being compiled. The assumption made in the comment for the CSV section is that the eager evaluation might cause an issue to occur when trying to run this code for large files. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explain why that assumption is right or wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reviewing the functions used in the code below the comments, I believe that the assumption is wrong. The code uses eager evaluations to open and read a CSV file, put them in a reader variable called reader, and then use the reader variable to put them in list variable to store each of the rows data called rows. This rows variable could then be used to examine the data. There is nothing being used that could affect the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is it safe to use the code above on large files?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, I believe that this code would be safe to use on large files. This is because of the type of evaluation and functions being used. There are no conditional statements or functions that could cause an issue based on file size."

    "## Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers hate code written for a specific case, \"I don't care if it can solve one special case, I want it to solve *all* cases.\" This generalization process is called **\"abstraction\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generalize the CSV->JSON code above into a function that can work for any CSV file and any JSON file (within reason).\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to convert in only one direction is only helpful half the time. Specious math aside, \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write a generalized JSON->CSV converter function.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the functions to do a \"round-trip\" (CSV->JSON->CSV or JSON->CSV->JSON) on the Consumer Complaint Database data found at https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/consumer-complaint-database#topic=consumer_navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done with the two functions, the original and the round-trip files should be reasonably identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Mac and Linux have a command line tool called 'diff' that will show differences between two files. Windows users can use the 'fc' command on the command line. See this answer on StackOverflow for alternatives: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6877238/what-is-the-windows-equivalent-of-the-diff-command\n",
    "\n",
    "**Also: No using libraries like Pandas that will automatically do the conversion!!** The purpose of this exercise is for you to get a fairly deep understanding of the two formats and using a converter will not fulfill that purpose. "

After 3 years of attempting to work with them, including lost paperwork, inaccurate claims ( ie home vacant when it was n't ), and changes in case workers, etc I finally contacted my local State Representative who managed to get XXXX XXXX XXXX to work with me. XX/XX/XXXX, I finally had a modification offer but it modified my home to over {$170000.00}. My home is only worth about {$69000.00}. When I asked about modifying it down to what it was worth, I was told to sign the modification and then XXXX XXXX XXXX would work on adjusting the modification down to its value. The only reason the amount was so high was due to XXXX XXXX XXXX taking over 3 years to modify my mortgage and their ineptitude with the process. XX/XX/XXXX, I was offered a job in XXXX, ND which I then accepted. My preference at that time, would have been to have to modification at the value of my home and then to rent the home out. As XXXX XXXX XXXX refused to honor their earlier agreement of renegotiating the modification down to the value of the home, it has now fallen into foreclosure and is vacant. After XXXX XXXX XXXX sold my mortgage to Carrington Mortgage-while in the middle of a modification, in XXXX XXXX, I again attempted the process and was denied any options. When I called to work with the company, I was told, on several occasions, different things. Once I was told to go ahead and short sale it, only to receive a letter later stating that was not possible. I also received a letter stating that I did not qualify for any options. XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice from a law firm representing XXXX XXXX XXXX that my foreclosure was being reopened. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received the attached legal work stating the foreclosure was in the 3 month redemption. After contacting both Carrington and XXXX XXXX XXXX over the course of the last 4 months, I have been told each other owns the mortgage, no one has foreclosed, the process has not been started, it has been started, XXXX XXXX XXXX is not allowed to do that, we do n't own the loan, we do own the loan, etc. My last conversation with Carrington stated that they are selling the mortgage effective XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and will not do anything with it, while the attorney for XXXX XXXX XXXX is trying to move forward with the foreclosure. I have been dealing with this for almost 4 years, with no solution in sight when this should have been completed over 3 years ago.

Sadly, Chex also adds inaccurate information to consumer files at the whim of their broken administrative processes. \\n\\nChexSystems absolves themselves of any responsibility for the accuracy of information contained in their systems, but instead casts responsibility to their customers, and forces the consumer to address problems directly with ChexSystems customers, unless providing a police report. Unfortunately some police agencies do n\\'t issue \" police reports \\'\\' when a crime has not been clearly consummated. In some cases a consumer may want to guard against the release of accurate consumer information to prevent perpetuating additional fraud. \\n\\nHaving gone through investigations with XXXX other Credit Reporting Agencies over the same set of fraudulent inquiries without a \" police report \\'\\', ALL of the interactions with other Credit Reporting Agencies were consumer friendly, were well defined, were conducted in a professional manner without putting personal information at risk, did not require \" re-investigations \\'\\', and resulted in the complete removal of all fraudulent and inaccurate information in my consumer file at their firms. \\n\\nDetails of the interactions with ChexSystems are contained in the attached file. ChexSystems does not provide direct contact information to a consumer to consult directly with a ChexSystems employee. Every communication sent from ChexSystems is sent to the consumer anonymously.', 'Tags': '', 'Date received': '08/22/2016', 'ZIP code': '', 'Company': 'Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.

I understand I have agreed to an over draft type of protection that I am charged a fee of {$34.00} when used. However, I did not agree to allow Chase to rearrange the order of my transactions to maximize fees. When I attempt to make a purchase or pay a bill using my bank card and there are not enough funds in my account my transaction is declined. I first realized something was amiss XXXX. I could not figure out why I had so many overdraft fees for transactions that I knew I had funds to cover and were approved. I went to the branch to sit down and go over each item with their representative. Neither he, his manager nor I could figure out how this happened but they were kind ( I think due to my being unemployed ) and credited me XXXX or XXXX of the many fees. When looking at the transactions as they were listed on my account it all made sense. However, when trying to get to the root of the problem I struggled - I knew I had adequate funds when I proceeded with the transactions and how could the transaction be approved if I was in the negative? Now that I closely monitor my account I have learned in the last few weeks that Chase rearranges the order transactions are posted and I firmly believe it is to maximize fees which I consider to be a predatory banking practice. They post larger dollar amount transactions first that snowball into {$34.00} fees for {$9.00} or {$10.00} transactions that would not be approved if funds were not available. In one instance One week I paid bills, grocery shopped and withdrew {$20.00} from my account. I did all this early in the week. All transactions were approved by the bank and all reflected on my account ( transactions are reflected same day ). A few days later I paid a bill that I knew I would utilize OD protection. Chase rearranged the transactions posting the higher bill payment first causing a {$34.00} fee, then {$100.00} transaction causing another {$34.00} fee then the {$9.00} and {$20.00} transactions charging XXXX more fees. My account had funds to cover all transactions when they occurred ( except the bill payment that occurred days after the other transactions ) and they were originally showing in the chronological order the transactions happened with a correct balance. I called the bank to review this with them detailing when transactions actually happened and how it originally showed correct chronological order and how the order changed after the bill payment but unfortunately I am dissatisfied with the outcome. They see no wrong doing on their part and because I already had XXXX courtesy credits of fees ( maximum allowed within a 12 month time frame ) they wo n't consider refunding more. I now do not consider the refunds I received in XXXX as a courtesy nor do I consider my current request as a courtesy because of their deliberate practice being a means to maximize fees. I have been charged approximately XXXX {$34.00} fees in the last month or so of which only XXXX are valid. This is more than my unemployment check. In addition, they have not covered all checks despite my having over draft protection. They returned a check but still charged me {$34.00} for returned check fee.\", 'Tags': '', 'Date received': '06/21/2016', 'ZIP code': '', 'Company': 'JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.', 'Sub-product': 'Checking account', 'Date sent to company': '06/21/2016', 'Consumer disputed?': 'No', 'State': 'NJ', 'Timely response?': 'Yes', 'Company response to consumer': 'Closed with explanation', 'Company public response': '', 'Submitted via': 'Web', 'Issue': 'Problems caused by my funds being low', 'Complaint ID': '1978474'}\n",

Meanwhile, I had my first credit card setup to pay the balance in full. In short, money was transferred from checking to clear the balance on the first card, and this pulled credit from the other card, which came with biannual fees and raising my interest rate from 19 % to 26 %.

I was checking my credit back in XX/XX/XXXX, still was not fixed I waited and check again in XX/XX/XXXX and notice again the information was wrong with XXXX XXXX, so I contacted the business and Experian to report incorrect information on my credit with XXXX XXXX, once again the loan and the monthly payment amount was incorrect.

So now inaccurate information remains after the complainant disputes it, and now they are not reporting the information to any Credit Agency.

If the finance department is reporting my loan information to their reporting company and the report company notifying the Credit Agency, why do I have to do their leg work? If I was late or stop paying they would rush to report. I also wanted to know if XXXX  ( private financing ) have to report the interest on my loan to the Credit Agencies, or should they only report the loan amount.

The XXXX was successful in getting the XXXX to add a notation to the official record that the payment was made in XXXX XXXX, but the XXXX still would not refile the release with the correct date. \\n\\nI submitted a request to Equifax that this be changed on my credit report. The result stated that the item was reporting correctly and thus was not removed. The notation made by the XXXX was evidently not enough proof. \\n\\nIn XXXX, I wrote to the new XXXX commissioner. This resulted in the local XXXX providing a signed letter stating that the improper recording date was not my fault, and that I paid the full amount in XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nI again submitted a dispute to Equifax. \\n\\nEquifax responded stating the item was not even reporting on my credit file. I have to assume they did not understand how to cross-reference the XXXX records with the XXXX 's records. I then called Equifax at the number provided and spoke to two phone representatives. Neither provided satisfactory answers to my questions and I requested a supervisor. I was transferred to someone in Equifax 's office of consumer affairs ( name withheld ). This person was professional and courteous, and helpful to a point. \\n\\nThe person listened to my concerns, but even with the clear evidence including an original, signed copy of the letter from the XXXX stating the correct payment date, the person would not make the correction. The person agreed to resubmit the dispute to the XXXX with all of the information I had provided. \\n\\nThe result of their new investigation was the same. They still claim the item is reporting correctly and will not remove it from my report. \\n\\nTo recap, the XXXX may be the reporting agency, but they are NOT the party to which the money was owed. In the mind of the XXXX, they are reporting the item correctly. However, the party to which the money was owed, the XXXX, confirms payment was made in full in XXXX XXXX. The XXXX also acknowledges it did not transmit the payoff information to the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) in a timely manner for recording. In fact, it was over 2 years late. \\n\\nTherefore, this item 's payment date should be reflected correctly on my credit report. If so, it will be well past the seven year threshold for removal. \\n\\nCompanies that wield as much power over consumers as does Equifax should be held to an extremely high standard. In my opinion, the company falls well below such a standard. They have not gone beyond a cursory check of public records to examine the evidence I 've provided and report this item correctly in my credit file. This practice is resulting in derogatory information on my credit report which should not be included. \\n\\nThe XXXX has attempted to help me twice to correct their error. I want Equifax to do the right thing and correct my report. \\n\\nReference docs uploaded : -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1 ) Official check for payment 2 ) 'Release of State Tax Execution ' updated with correct payment date 3 ) Letter from XXXX stating correct payment date\", 'Tags': '', 'Date received': '03/26/2016', 'ZIP code': '319XX', 'Company': 'EQUIFAX, INC.', 'Sub-product': '', 'Date sent to company': '03/26/2016', 'Consumer disputed?': 'Yes', 'State': 'GA', 'Timely response?': 'Yes', 'Company response to consumer': 'Closed with explanation', 'Company public response': '', 'Submitted via': 'Web', 'Issue': \"Credit reporting company's investigation\", 'Complaint ID': '1851158'}\n",

Two days later while checking my account I found that the monies did not go into either account but instead Bank of America took {$100.00} out of my savings and {$100.00} out of my checking account and then placed a hold on both accounts.\\nIt took two days and multiple calls and even visiting a local branch before theyd agree to put my monies back into my account that they illegally took out. Mind you though that they still had a hold on my check. At the advice of the rep I spoke to over the phone, the suggestion was made that I go into the bank and present the physical check to them and the hold would come off, but this never happened. The took my physical check and deposited and a day later I found it was rejected and that the initial 10-day hold would still be in effect. The monies from the check has come out the account of the person that gave me the check over a week ago and Bank of America is still insisting on holding the check until XX/XX/XXXX. The reason they are holding the check is merely because I tried to split the check between two accounts. Their app allowed me to do this and even gave me a confirmation that it was done.\\nI called again today and spoke with a supervisor who called their Risk Department and I was advised that they couldnt release my funds because they didnt have a good image of the check. This upset me because it was a lie. They had perfect image from my phone deposit and they have the physical check from the bank.\\nMy main concern and contention is that if were not allowed to split checks why does your banking app initially allow it? Why wouldnt you put a disclaimer on the site, so your customers dont have to go thru this? And if this is the banking institutions failure why as the consumer must we suffer for it? And heres the biggest thing. Bank of America has had my XXXX for over a week making interest off it and refusing to give it to me until theyre ready which will be XX/XX/XXXX. This is illegal and although its only a XXXX my rights are being violated and Im thinking of seeking legal counsel. The rep on the phone told me that this happens all the time, and she agreed that they should do something about it, but they dont? The reason they dont is because theyre benefiting. I want to make sure they dont do this to other people.\\nSincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, FL XXXX XXXX', 'Tags': '', 'Date received': '11/13/2017', 'ZIP code': '334XX', 'Company': 'BANK OF AMERICA, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION', 'Sub-product': 'Checking account', 'Date sent to company': '11/13/2017', 'Consumer disputed?': 'N/A', 'State': 'FL', 'Timely response?': 'Yes', 'Company response to consumer': 'Closed with explanation', 'Company public response': 'Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response', 'Submitted via': 'Web', 'Issue': 'Managing an account', 'Complaint ID': '2728195'}\n",

I have included the certified mail receipt and copy of the authorization mailed to XXXX XXXX XXXX After that I waited for the debit to come through it was n't until XXXX/2017 that the debit came through but it hit as a charge from LCA. At the time I did n't know who that was until the bank told me. I then filed a complaint with my bank of an unauthorized transaction by this LCA, as I have no business with them nor have I ever heard of them. I sent authorization to XXXX XXXX to collect a debt and they did n't get it so I thought. So the bank refunded my bank account when I advised them of this. They told me they were n't able to stop the payment so as a result they closed the card associated with the transaction and paid this company who stole from my account because XXXX XXXX gave them my banking information. So on XXXX XXXX  2017 I paid the original creditor via bill pay sent by my bank as a check to settle the debt and again XXXX XXXX sent the check to LCA. I found this out when I received the check mailed to the original creditor in an envelope from LCA stating it is not acceptable as you will see in the documentation I 'm uploading. Therefore LCA is reporting inaccurate information to the credit bureaus in an effort to harm my credibility. I paid this account to the original creditor upon being notified of the balance. They maliciously sent the payment to LCA not once but twice in an effort to discredit me. It is n't right. LCA has already stolen from me and now they have the audacity to report a paid debt to an original creditor ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) as a collection when they know this creditor actually gave them money for a paid account. I have never and will never do business with a collection agency because I pay my bills when I am informed of them. Plain and simple I knew there was a bill and I paid it and LCA has clearly violated FCRA regulations by reporting to a third party a debt they know is paid in an effort to assist XXXX XXXX XXXX with this fraudulent claim of debt. I demand that LCA remove this fraudulent and illegal information from my credit report. The account has been paid to XXXX XXXX twice and here is the proof sent to me by LCA from the original creditor. I have never had any business with LCA and will not. I 'm not liable for how an original creditor handle payments and aside from this LCA is reporting inaccurate amounts. I owed and paid {$94.00} to XXXX XXXX not the {$95.00} they are reporting.\", 'Tags': '', 'Date received': '05/28/2017', 'ZIP code': '309XX', 'Company': 'LANIER COLLECTIONS AGENCY AND SERVICES INC', 'Sub-product': 'Credit reporting', 'Date sent to company': '05/30/2017', 'Consumer disputed?': 'N/A', 'State': 'GA', 'Timely response?': 'Yes', 'Company response to consumer': 'Closed with explanation', 'Company public response': '', 'Submitted via': 'Web', 'Issue': 'Incorrect information on your report', 'Complaint ID': '2496027'}\n",

I have recently filed a complaint with CFPB, case # XXXX, and have receive a very unclear response.

To my knowledge, the bank is NOT making transactions WITH XXXX, NOR IN XXXX. I am a private citizen and live in the US for many years, I am a resident of this country and pay taxed as a resident. The back of the letter you sent me explicitly states that ECOA prohibits discrimination based on many factors, including national origin, provided the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract. In my opinion, my credit records do show my capabilities and trustworthiness, unless you can present a reason why you would think otherwise. QUESTION 3 : how come your sole reason for the denial is my citizenship/immigration status? Isn\\'t that a direct violation of the ECOA laws? I say : look at my credit score, not my passport! \\n\\n3. I was speaking several times with CITI BANK representatives and have been told repeatedly that CITI does not discriminate, even though in my mind, this is a direct discrimination based on citizenship status. QUESTION 4 : to help me better understand the discriminatory policy, please, provide a hypothetical example, where your company would indeed discriminate someone based on the same factor. \\n\\n4. QUESTION 5 : does CITI BANK have a unified policy towards ALL applicants? What I mean is whether any non-US citizen or XXXX XXXX holder is not able to obtain a XXXX credit card?

It was purchased, to our knowledge, in XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, unknown to us, we were one month behind on our payments to XXXX due to a missed payment in XX/XX/XXXX due to an Illness. The payment was overlooked and we were never contacted by XXXX by letter, email or phone to be able to address the Issue and make the missed payment. We have since learned about the missed payment after hiring Council. Only then did Seterus inform us of the missed payment. We have since rectified the missed payment on XX/XX/XXXX for {$2600.00}. We also gave Seterus specific instructions in writing on the cashiers check that the money was to go to the XX/XX/XXXX missed payment or was not to be cashed. Seterus refused to abide by the instructions on the check and cashed the check anyway. When ask why, they explained that wasnt the way they did their accounting and the money was placed into a existing Suspense Account. \\nIn XX/XX/XXXX XXXX  notified us by letter that the loan had been purchased and we were to begin making our payments to Seterus in XX/XX/XXXX. We never received any correspondence from Seterus at that time. We didnt receive a new contract to sign so we assumed Seterus had adopted the same contract we had with XXXX XXXX XXXX. We complied with the letter from XXXX and set up an account on the Seterus Website and began making our payments on XX/XX/XXXX even though we hadnt received a statement from Seterus at the time. It wasnt until after we had made XXXX payment, that we received XXXX statement from Seterus. They had Immediately began charging us a late fee and demanded a {$7900.00} payment that was due XX/XX/XXXX. When we contacted them about the amount, their response was that we had missed our  XXXX payment and we also had to reimburse them for the Escrow disbursement of {$5900.00} and {$280.00}. We explained to them at that time, our payment had been made on-line to them on XX/XX/XXXX as we were instructed to do. We also explained that the Escrow payment should have come from our existing Escrow account with XXXX. Those explanations fell on deaf ears. We received our first of three statements for XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX showing we owed {$7900.00} for XXXX payment. This statement also included prior activity with Seterus, although we had never done business with before, showing a XXXX payment and XXXX payment of {$2600.00} respectively. The Statement also showed two Tax Disbursement made on XX/XX/XXXX for  {$5900.00} and {$280.00}. Money, we thought, should have come from funds in our Escrow account  with XXXX. After visiting our Tax Assessor about the Issue, the Tax Assessor explained to us that only two payments had been recorded to our account on XX/XX/XXXX. Both being by Seterus. Meaning that XXXX XXXX XXXX did not make our XX/XX/XXXX tax payment and were still in possession of account funds or Seterus was withholding Escrow funds and refusing to tell us and then demanding we pay them for the dispersed funds. Only after a Escrow Account statement showing a {$7800.00} surplus, did Seterus acknowledge the existence of the funds and after request from council, still refused to refund us our money until we had paid them what they said we owed them. Money that was never owed to them in the first place.\\n\\nSeterus continues to engage in unscrupulous tactics to get us to pay money that is not owed to them. Seterus continually threatens to foreclose on our home every month and continually sends us unsolicited offers for a Loan Modification that we have never requested, wanting to lower our payments by extending our note to forty years. Seterus continues to harm our credit rating by reporting us late on our payments which has caused us unneeded expenses. We are unable to refinance our Mortgage at the present lower interest rate because of this also. They refuse to acknowledge our Attorney and our Accountant, that we have paid hundreds of dollars for, even after Seterus was sent documentation by our CPA verifying their mistake.\\n\\nWe respectfully request your help in rectifying this unfortunate issue as soon as possible so we may be able to go on with our lives without fear of having our home taken from us and our credit continually being ruined.\\n\\nPlease see attached documentation verifying our claims.', 'Tags': '', 'Date received': '02/22/2018', 'ZIP code': '', 'Company': 'Seterus, Inc.', 'Sub-product': 'Conventional home mortgage', 'Date sent to company': '02/22/2018', 'Consumer disputed?': 'N/A', 'State': 'TX', 'Timely response?': 'Yes', 'Company response to consumer': 'Closed with monetary relief', 'Company public response': 'Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response', 'Submitted via': 'Web', 'Issue': 'Trouble during payment process', 'Complaint ID': '2823093'}\n",

As of today I did not received the refund. \\n\\nI opened a dispute with citicard on XX/XX/XXXX and provided very detailed documentation of the purchase ( 28 pages in total ), appraisals of the ring, confirmation of the return of the ring to XXXX XXXX XXXX  and email traffic between me and the seller, who acknowledged receiving the ring and to refund me the {$11000.00}. \\n\\nI called and chatted with the citicard dispute office in 3 occasions just to make sure they had everything they needed. The answer was always yes and that they would come back to me with a resolution. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, without any previous notice, I received an email from citicard that 2 of the 28 pages I\\'ve sent them were not readable and declined my dispute. The {$11000.00} were back on my credit card. I called citicard dispute office to verify my next step and after receiving instructions I resubmitted all the documentation again with a \" more readable \\'\\' version of the two pages they were questioning about. I called and talked to two dispute specialists again who ensured me that all the pages now were readable and that another specialist would get back to me in a few days. The people I\\'ve interacted with so far don\\'t seem to even read my emails or the documentation I\\'ve provided. One of them even told me that my documentation never made it to the seller financial institution. Between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX nobody at citicard even looked at the details of my dispute. \\n\\nThis should be an easier resolution considering I\\'ve returned the ring to the seller and I\\'ve the message from the seller acknowledging the ring was not a center stone aquamarine but a center stone topaz ring of a much lesser value. I even have provided the message from the seller who agrees to refund the {$11000.00}. I\\'m not confident in the ability of citicard to handle this issue properly. I\\'ve been a valued customer for more than 15 years and in those 15 years only two disputes for less than {$40.00}. I was not expecting such poor customer service. \\n\\nFor additional clarification about this issue, see details below of the opening statement I\\'ve provided to Citicard ( additional documentation to support my claim can be provided as needed ) : I\\'ve purchased from XXXX XXXX XXXX, owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX, a ring that was sold and advertised as an aquamarine and diamond ring valued at {$68000.00} ( I have the XXXX   appraisal report that XXXX provided as documentation ). The ring was sold to me at {$11000.00}. \\nWhen I received the ring, I had the impression that the center stone was a lot darker than the pictures XXXX XXXX send me and I decided to engage a reputable and certified XXXX appraiser to validate the authenticity of the ring ( XXXX appraisers are the only recognized appraiser service in the country ). When I initially purchase the ring the seller told me that the ring was coming with a XXXX appraisal, not an XXXX appraisal which is the one they  provided. I got nervous and decided to engage a local reputable appraiser. My appraiser documented that the ring was not an aquamarine, but a topaz of a much lesser value and some of the diamonds were questionable. His suggestion was to return the ring because he didnt think this was a reputable seller.The value of the ring based on my private appraisal was approximately {$7900.00} and assumed the diamonds were real, which he doubted strongly but some of them were so small he could not tell. \\nAfter this discovery, I tried to contact the seller without success. The phone number was disconnected. I was able to reach by phone the XXXX appraiser the seller has engaged, who was shocked to hear what happened and ensured me the ring he has appraised was an aquamarine. He also told me he would contact the owner of XXXX XXXX and would make sure he would call me back. \\nWhen I was finally able to talk to XXXX XXXX ( the owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX ) via phone, he said the ring was authentic and ensured me that my appraiser was mistaken. To prove my appraiser wrong, he agreed to do a XXXX appraisal himself, free of charge for me, just to show me that his XXXX appraisal he originally sent was accurate. He also agreed to refund the full {$11000.00} if the ring was in fact a topaz of much lesser value ( I have documentation of this ). I then sent the ring back and was received by XXXX XXXX it on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nThe XXXX report came back to XXXX XXXX and I got confirmation from him that my appraiser was right : the center stone was in fact a topaz and not an aquamarine. I asked for XXXX XXXX to honor his commitment to refund me the full amount of {$11000.00}. He was apologetic and said he would issue a credit immediately. Since then, not only XXXX XXXX has not returned my messages and calls, but the credit has not been issued, as hes committed to do. Not only he\\'s the ring, but he has my money.', 'Tags': '', 'Date received': '06/19/2018', 'ZIP code': '750XX', 'Company': 'CITIBANK, N.A.', 'Sub-product': 'General-purpose credit card or charge card', 'Date sent to company': '06/19/2018', 'Consumer disputed?': 'N/A', 'State': 'TX', 'Timely response?': 'Yes', 'Company response to consumer': 'Closed with explanation', 'Company public response': 'Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response', 'Submitted via': 'Web', 'Issue': 'Problem with a purchase shown on your statement', 'Complaint ID': '2940046'}\n",

I already did this and it worked as the process was supposed to with all other issues and with the other 2 reporting bureaus. Now I have to wait between XXXX days for my credit report to show this ; and 2. I 'm not going to be able to close on my home loan on time because of this, and I 'm going to have to scramble to make alternative living arrangements and expenses, and may see the seller pull out of the deal leaving me to also try and find a new place to live permanently!\", 'Tags': '', 'Date received': '04/10/2015', 'ZIP code': '474XX', 'Company': 'EQUIFAX, INC.', 'Sub-product': '', 'Date sent to company': '04/10/2015', 'Consumer disputed?': 'No', 'State': 'IN', 'Timely response?': 'Yes', 'Company response to consumer': 'Closed with explanation', 'Company public response': '', 'Submitted via': 'Web', 'Issue': 'Incorrect information on credit report', 'Complaint ID': '1324304'}\n",

Please note the only way to complete the modification according to Mr.Cooper/Nations Star besides complete the trial payments was to pay XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX ( which we did with two separate payments ) one cashier 's check, the other personal check which was cashed/cleared. Both payments were sent via XXXX. Although the person called to express congratulations on the modification she said she was calling to ask if we were behind on any Home Owner Association dues. I gave her the information, Then she told me she was calling about our XX/XX/XXXX payment. I nearly loss it, because these were already sent and we are attempting to move forward. First she stated she could not find any payments we made, then she said she did find it and stated we owed more. After about 15 minutes, she said there is {$110.00} missing and she would put in a request to see what happened to {$110.00}, but she found the two payments. Then she said she could take a payment for XXXX, so I gave her our bank information. The next day I called the number she gave me and said it was her direct line. I called the number and the number was Mr. Cooper but not assign to anyone. Additionally when I called back and spoke to another person she said WE OWED FOR XXXXXXXX,  at this point I hate we have gotten into this type of mortgage with such confusing transactions and inexperienced customer service people who may not have the proper knowledge and abilities when speaking to homeowners on mortgage payments, escrow, taxes and basic customer service.

I move the money from my bank account that would have paid XXXX XXXX mortgage because I was told it was for XXXX when I know it should be for XX/XX/XXXX.

These are the types of experiences which makes excuses for them unacceptable.

Property taxes are only {$370.00} per year, & XXXX property hazard insurance was {$2000.00}. {$250.00} of each mortgage payment was being deposited into escrow throughout XXXX, which should have easily covered these amounts for the year.

XXXX XXXX is reporting to the credit bureaus that I have Missed Payments XXXX XXXX admits they would not accept payments during a review process for a loan Modification which spanned over 5 months. How is it okay for them to not accept my payments and to continue to charge me late fees, report missed payments and report late payments. I am believe this to be fraudulent, predatory and unethical. I further believe it is in direct violation of the FCRA. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX worked on our modification for 5 months then denied our request for assistance. During that 5 months I initiated communication with them on almost every occasion. On many occasions the application was stalled in one department or another until I initiated contact urging them to move the application along. After 5 months the application was denied because it was deemed our income was too high to qualify for the program, a program which they recommended to us. XXXX XXXX had our income amounts on the first day we submitted the application. Because the process took so long the late fees piled up and the fraudulent credit report continued. XXXX XXXX at inception claimed the process could take as little as 10 days, in our case it was over 140 days. This is a case of a fraudulent Bait and Switch tactic. \\n\\nXXXX XXXX reports to the credit bureaus that my payments for XX/XX/2018 to XX/XX/2018 are 120-149 days late these payments were paid in a lump sum in early XXXX the reporting is fraudulent In summary I feel we have been victim of predatory lending, charged illegal fees and are victims of fraudulent reporting to the credit bureaus. These violations are well within your purview. I urge you to request our file from XXXX XXXX, it will show that we pleaded with them to expedite the modification process. Ask XXXX XXXX for the phone transcripts, they will show that they repeatedly lied to us and assured on many occasions that the process would be completed by a certain date which came and went until we again initiated contact. Ask for the original loan documents they refer to, that they allege allows them to not accept payments yet charge late fees and report fraudulently to the credit bureaus. Furthermore, recognize that XXXX XXXX is being sued on a regular basis for its unethically and illegal practices we are another one of their victims. Dont allow them to send you a canned response form letter like they did to the State oh NH DOJ. \\n\\nBecause of their fraudulent reporting we have recently denied credit 3 times, stuck with them because due to their reporting we are unable to get our loan moved to another lender. \\n\\nLastly, XXXX XXXX offered us a program allegedly to help people in need with unique circumstances after you review our application you be the judge if we fit that criterion, I am confident you will agree we should have been immediately approved or maybe this is yet another predatory program XXXX XXXX is pushing or faking!

I advised them that this was unauthorized transfer and that Barclay did it without authorizing it through me and did the transfer anyway and using an arbitrary amount of their own choosing and an amount other than what I agreed to on the application. \\n\\nI said that since it was in my mind an unauthorized transaction the responsibility of it falls on them to reverse this transaction and the burden to send them money is not on me.

Neither I was phone discussion with him on XX/XX/XXXX he sated about final date was XX/XX/XXXX. Nor CFPB was informed neither its states in his email funds was returned. He gain reiterated to me he dose not send email and due date was XX/XX/XXXX and funds was returned on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nIts over 48 hours I have received no information from WFB. \\nI called XXXX spoke to XXXX and she than twisted things little bit and stated to me she was able to see funds being returned on XX/XX/XXXX and funds was received on XX/XX/XXXX. She told me things are done differently in their office it is done electronically. By using electronically funds should not take about one month to be received by XXXX. She did not provide me reason why it took abut one months to received funds. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX from XXXX also contradicted herself by stating she could see funds being in process of returned but funds was officially returned on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX never stated to me she could funds being returned on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nBased on my discussion with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX I was explained XXXX could see funds are being returned but she had no detail as on that time. My email to her on XX/XX/XXXX confirmation from WFB nothing was stated that on XX/XX/XXXX funds was returned when according WFB funds was returned on XX/XX/XXXX ( Attached ) also she contradicted herself on XX/XX/XXXX she stated she could see funds were being returned on XX/XX/XXXX but did not mention this to me XX/XX/XXXX. \\nWFB is involved in corruption letters sent to me, phone calls made to and to CFPB no stated funds were returned or last date was XX/XX/XXXX. There was never at any point of time during my phone conversation, email to manager XXXX, letter I was informed last date to receive documents was XX/XX/XXXX. Email conformation attached was dose not indicates that. About 20 email to XXXX XXXX not even singe was replied what I call BULLING AND CORRUPTION. ( Attached ). XXXX has no excuse and that XXXX XXXX was not getting my email. My email with documents emailed to him in which I asked him to confirm me if entire documents were received and he did. \\nEmail confirmation which was received on XX/XX/XXXX dose not state funds was returned on XX/XX/XXXX.  DOJ and FBI will be filed complaint to investigate this corruption. \\nEven if the funds were returned on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX never received it until XX/XX/XXXX close to one month late. No funds was returned on XX/XX/XXXX but it was received on XX/XX/XXXX and it was re tuned around XX/XX/XXXX. DOJ will and FBI will have investigated this corruption and fraud. It dose not even takes mail to arrive about one month it normally takes 2 days. Here funds were received on XX/XX/XXXX and I have recorded discussion form XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Its just corruption by WFB. I have recorded conversation with XXXX from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX she confirmed to me returned funds was received on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nBULLING AND ADVANTAGE WFB by holding lien is bulling us which I have stated before and stating this. Now. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I had telephone discussion with XXXX who called me to request for an extension to provide my answers to my dispute items. He did not stated to me in the conversation which is recoded yesterday which was XX/XX/XXXX was last to get the singed documents and it was late. Will provide that recoded conversation. He never stated funds will be returned CORRUPTION AND FRAUD Multiple letters received by XXXX after XX/XX/XXXX dose not states funds was returned because last date to provide singed documents was XX/XX/XXXX. ( Attached ) WFB is taking advantage its position by holding line that they can decided either way and I have to accept it. From XX/XX/XXXX,  XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX I have not received my disputed facts with back up documents why they disagree or agree. \\nONLY THING I HAVE RECEIVED ABOUT 60 EXTENSIONS Like wise my XX/XX/XXXX letter over close to 100 pages has not been received with back up documents why WFB agrees or disagree. Neither they have provided to CFPB. All WFB has done is kept asking for extension and close to 60 extension has been made to provide me an answers. Despite this manger XXXX insisted with me there is nothing wrong with amount and all are correct. Accounts are not the only issues but there are many other issues and manger XXXX is incompetent state to me all are correct. I will prove her wrong if she ones to get 3 party conference with CFPB and Senator XXXX. \\nAs she stated amounts are correct she must leave WFB for stating amounts are correct when attached documents indicates XX/XX/XXXX payments has not been applied to my account. It indicates its sitting in un applied funds. Manager XXXX is incompetent should reign for providing me wrong information which is recorded. \\nLike wise manager XXXX amount on XX/XX/XXXX letter un applied balance was $ {$47.00}, XXXX and modification documents of XX/XX/XXXX was {$73000.00} additional {$25000.00} she just can tell me that is correct but provide me back up copies what extra {$25000.00} has been added for and why.

One of my trucks needed a repair. I hired a mechanic to do the repair on XX/XX/XXXX. He told us he installed new batteries and a new starter on the truck. The mechanic stated his work was guaranteed and I paid him with my TD Bank XXXX credit card {$2300.00} for this repair.

As a result of a series of legislation called Act 10, I was forced to take a cut in take home pay of almost XXXX per month. I immediately began trying to work with XXXX XXXX XXXX to modify my home loan into something affordable. I was told that I had to be 45 days behind in order to start a modification process, so I allowed myself to fall behind to start the process ( I was running about 29 days late prior ). After 3 years of attempting to work with them, including lost paperwork, inaccurate claims ( ie home vacant when it was n\\'t ), and changes in case workers, etc I finally contacted my local State Representative who managed to get XXXX XXXX XXXX to work with me. XX/XX/XXXX, I finally had a modification offer but it modified my home to over {$170000.00}. My home is only worth about {$69000.00}. When I asked about modifying it down to what it was worth, I was told to sign the modification and then XXXX XXXX XXXX would work on adjusting the modification down to its value. The only reason the amount was so high was due to XXXX XXXX XXXX taking over 3 years to modify my mortgage and their ineptitude with the process. XX/XX/XXXX, I was offered a job in XXXX, ND which I then accepted. My preference at that time, would have been to have to modification at the value of my home and then to rent the home out. As XXXX XXXX XXXX refused to honor their earlier agreement of renegotiating the modification down to the value of the home, it has now fallen into foreclosure and is vacant. After XXXX XXXX XXXX sold my mortgage to Carrington Mortgage-while in the middle of a modification, in XXXX XXXX, I again attempted the process and was denied any options. When I called to work with the company, I was told, on several occasions, different things. Once I was told to go ahead and short sale it, only to receive a letter later stating that was not possible. I also received a letter stating that I did not qualify for any options. XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice from a law firm representing XXXX XXXX XXXX that my foreclosure was being reopened. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received the attached legal work stating the foreclosure was in the 3 month redemption. After contacting both Carrington and XXXX XXXX XXXX over the course of the last 4 months, I have been told each other owns the mortgage, no one has foreclosed, the process has not been started, it has been started, XXXX XXXX XXXX is not allowed to do that, we do n\\'t own the loan, we do own the loan, etc. My last conversation with Carrington stated that they are selling the mortgage effective XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and will not do anything with it, while the attorney for XXXX XXXX XXXX is trying to move forward with the foreclosure. I have been dealing with this for almost 4 years, with no solution in sight when this should have been completed over 3 years ago.

My monthly statements are consistently reflecting 2 months of payments due. I have contacted the mortgage company every month to better understand why this is occurring, as I am submitting my monthly payments well before the XXXX of each month. Initially i received a statement for XXXX reflecting 2 months due for my mortgage ( XXXX & XXXX ). I noted a correspondence that stated my loan was sold at the end of XXXX, but no account information provided by new service provider SUNTRUST. I reached out to SUNTRUST to make an online payment prior to XX/XX/XXXX to maintain my account current. In the XXXX billing statement I understood why system generated the dual payment due as the conversion time being noted. However for the XXXX Billing statement did not understand why still showing 2 payments being due.

       " ',Bank account or service,Consent provided,\"I have come to realize Chase bank has been rearranging the order of my transactions to maximize fees and it has snowballed out of control. I understand I have agreed to an over draft type of protection that I am charged a fee of {$34.00} when used. However, I did not agree to allow Chase to rearrange the order of my transactions to maximize fees. When I attempt to make a purchase or pay a bill using my bank card and there are not enough funds in my account my transaction is declined. I first realized something was amiss XXXX. I could not figure out why I had so many overdraft fees for transactions that I knew I had funds to cover and were approved. I went to the branch to sit down and go over each item with their representative. Neither he, his manager nor I could figure out how this happened but they were kind ( I think due to my being unemployed ) and credited me XXXX or XXXX of the many fees. When looking at the transactions as they were listed on my account it all made sense. However, when trying to get to the root of the problem I struggled - I knew I had adequate funds when I proceeded with the transactions and how could the transaction be approved if I was in the negative? Now that I closely monitor my account I have learned in the last few weeks that Chase rearranges the order transactions are posted and I firmly believe it is to maximize fees which I consider to be a predatory banking practice. They post larger dollar amount transactions first that snowball into {$34.00} fees for {$9.00} or {$10.00} transactions that would not be approved if funds were not available. In one instance One week I paid bills, grocery shopped and withdrew {$20.00} from my account. I did all this early in the week. All transactions were approved by the bank and all reflected on my account ( transactions are reflected same day ). A few days later I paid a bill that I knew I would utilize OD protection. Chase rearranged the transactions posting the higher bill payment first causing a {$34.00} fee, then {$100.00} transaction causing another {$34.00} fee then the {$9.00} and {$20.00} transactions charging XXXX more fees. My account had funds to cover all transactions when they occurred ( except the bill payment that occurred days after the other transactions ) and they were originally showing in the chronological order the transactions happened with a correct balance. I called the bank to review this with them detailing when transactions actually happened and how it originally showed correct chronological order and how the order changed after the bill payment but unfortunately I am dissatisfied with the outcome. They see no wrong doing on their part and because I already had XXXX courtesy credits of fees ( maximum allowed within a 12 month time frame ) they wo n\\'t consider refunding more. I now do not consider the refunds I received in XXXX as a courtesy nor do I consider my current request as a courtesy because of their deliberate practice being a means to maximize fees. I have been charged approximately XXXX {$34.00} fees in the last month or so of which only XXXX are valid. This is more than my unemployment check. In addition, they have not covered all checks despite my having over draft protection. They returned a check but still charged me {$34.00} for returned check fee.\",,06/21/2016,,JPMORGAN CHASE & CO.,Checking account,06/21/2016,No,NJ,Yes,Closed with explanation,,Web,Problems caused by my funds being low,1978474\\n',\n",

I was also reported late during forbearance and was sent to dept collection agency during forbearance. I was told that I had to pay back all the past due in one lump sum or risk foreclosure on my home. I informed my mortgage servicer that I could not pay that and requested a loan modification. It took from XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX to get my loan mod complete, all in between I was reported late for 7 months on my credit reports. XXXX XXXX owns my mortgage and I opened up a claim with them. After some time, I was told by XXXX XXXX that the way this mortgage serve handled my account was incorrect. XXXX XXXX   contacted my mortgage servicer and informed them that per XXXX XXXX guideline, I should not of been reported late during any of this and that the negative reporting was to be removed from my credit. This is not the case. I have filed disputes directly with the credit bureaus, and my mortgage services keeps sending over false/incorrect information when I dispute it. My family has suffered financial hardship over this, my credit is now trashed. I also suspect that this servicer has falsified their service records as now my account seems to show different information according to the customer service reps that service the account when I contact them. I can prove that incorrect information was sent over to the credit agencies, and I can also prove that this servicer has broken RESPA and XXXX XXXX  guidelines.

The loan amount is currently {$13000.00} and the monthly payments is XXXX, however I pay XXXX - biweekly, never been lately or missed or payment. So now inaccurate information remains after the complainant disputes it, and now they are not reporting the information to any Credit Agency. The owner did reach out but he was asking me to send him information to show my loan amount and my credit report to show the loan is closed. If the finance department is reporting my loan information to their reporting company and the report company notifying the Credit Agency, why do I have to do their leg work? If I was late or stop paying they would rush to report. I also wanted to know if XXXX  ( private financing ) have to report the interest on my loan to the Credit Agencies, or should they only report the loan amount.
