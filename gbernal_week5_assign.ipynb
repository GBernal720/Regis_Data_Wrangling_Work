Any industry that has a large volume of daily mathematical calculations to do, most likely use a mainframe computer as part of their normal operations. For example, the banking industry. Certainly, the website and customer-facing applications are not run on a mainframe computer, but the nightly accounting processes probably are. \n",

However, we have little to no information about what the numerics at the end of each line mean. Or even how many fields the numeric group is representing. The last line is leading us to believe that there might be more than one field represented, but we are not confident at this point.\n"
