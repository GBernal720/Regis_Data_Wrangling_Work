    "Formally, there are several different types of database. Relational, NoSQL, Graph, Object, Data Warehouse, etc. They all exist to provide organization and rapid access to data. Although it can be fun to study and use some of the more esoteric types (yes, I said \"fun.\" I'm a wild man on Saturday night, believe me), we will only be looking at relational and NoSQL as being the two most common types in wide use today.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relational - SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "You had a bit of an introduction to SQL and relational databases in Week 2. This week we will build on that knowledge by creating simple database tables to handle emails. \n",
    "\n",
    "The term \"relational\" comes from a research paper by E. F. Cobb in 1970. \"A relational Model for Large Shared Data Banks\" described a bunch of features a relational data store should have (12 of them) but no commercial database conforms to that standard. We generally recognize a relational data base as a *table-based* system where rows are discreet data points (a person, an order item, an inventory item, etc.) and columns are the attributes or details about the entry, as well as a set of operations that relate tables to each other (more on this later). \n",

    "One important feature of these tables is the \"id\" column on the left side (emp_id and dept_id). **Every** table will have some way to make every row unique. Since we cannot guarantee there will *never* be repeats, we add a synthetic \"id\" column that uniquely identies each row. That way, even if there are two John Smiths, we have at least one way to single each one out. In this case, emp_id is the **primary key** in the employee table. Similarly, dept_id is the primary key of the departments table. \n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also notice that the employee table has a column called **dept_id**. This is because dept_id is a **foreign key** in the employee table. Instead of writing (and repeating) the department name in the employees table, we put in a reference to the departments table. There are a variety of reasons to do this referencing including, \n",

    "* Making tables smaller and more space-efficient,\n",
    "* Making data easier to correct and less error prone\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, that foreign key is what *relates* those two tables to each other. \n",
    "\n",

    "* __Document__ - Stores semi-structured JSON documents. Very popular with web applications storing unique documents like catalogs or user profiles that evolve over time. MongoDB and CouchBase are two popular examples.\n",
    "* __Graph__ - Data is stored in record-like nodes which are interconnected by lines called edges that represent relationships between nodes. Graph databases these relationships in a more flexible and dynamic way than traditional relational databases. Examples include Neo4j and IBM Graph.\n",
    "* __Key-value__ - Store data much like a Python dictionary. Every value is accessed by some unique key and values can be complex objects like lists, documents, files, etc. Redis and Riak are popular examples. \n",
    "* __Wide column__ - Records in tables are organized by column instead of by row. This allows for very fast access to large volumes of data. Google Big Table, Cassandra, and HBase are examples."

    "Python 3.7 introduced a great new language feature called **Dataclasses**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes, in general, can be described as containers for objects and the functions that modify the objects' attributes.  Dataclasses do the same thing with some shortcuts for those attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several different ways to create data containers have been used, such as tuples or dictionaries, namedtuples, and a library called **attrs**, which was the inspiration for dataclasses. RealPython.com has a great dataclass tutorial that demonstrates all those methods and compares them to dataclasses, as well as showing more advanced usage of dataclasses than we will get into at https://realpython.com/python-data-classes/.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the typical `import` statement, we create a dataclass using a `@dataclass` **decorator**. Decorators are explained in more detail in MSDE 620, Week 5 and the tutorial at https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/. In brief, a decorator can be considered a \"wrapper\" around a function that modifies that function's behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the the case of dataclasses, the decorator allows us to change the behavior of the `class` keyword\n",
    "\n",
    "Our class will be called `EmailMessage` and it will hold the attributes we printed from the test message: From, To, Cc, Date, Subject, Body.\n",

    "Many times, when we have large, slow tasks, we break them up into smaller tasks and try to do more than one of them at once. Although there are other definitions and uses, this is called parallel processing. Unfortunately, Python was written before \"multi-core\" CPUs were even a concept. Due to this, a shortcut was taken to mitigate inherent problems with multi-threading: the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). When one Python thread is running on the CPU, the GIL locks out all other Python threads. Also unfortunately, the GIL is such a fundamental part of the Python interpreter, it cannot really be removed to take advantage of modern CPUs.\n",

Even though our mail parsing is I/O-bound, we will investigate multiprocessing to help speed up ingestion. **Note:** there are a few libraries and methods to help make multiprocessing easier but we will stay with the Python standard library tool, **concurrent futures.**\n",
